<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>* Concentrate on one family of languages, the OO ones</p>
<p>* Change one feature which is overdue for an upgrade</p>
<p>* Explore the consequences</p>
<p>OO languages <em>in principle</em> allow you to build complex
programs from small, robust, bullet-proof components</p>
<p>Sources of ideas: <a class="jump" href="#Haskell">Haskell</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#concurrency">concurrency</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#teaching">teaching</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#patterns">design patterns</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#harmful">... considered harmful</a>
</p>
</section>

<aside id="Haskell">
<h2>Haskell</h2>
<p>One of the important contributions of Haskell to the wider world is that
ideas from it spread out into other languages</p>
<p>An early question was "what is the next idea that should make it across the
gap"</p>
<p>This followed on from previous research in the Haskell area</p>
</aside>

<aside id="concurrency">
<h2>Concurrency</h2>
<p>Current approaches to concurrency in most languages seem (arguably) to
border on the diabolical</p>
<p>Some previous research on <dfn>deterministic concurrency</dfn> in functional
languages seemed worth pursuing in other languages</p>
</aside>

<aside id="teaching">
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>In my experience of teaching Java, it has a lot of strange details, but they
are mostly easy to explain</p>
<p>But the need for, and the self-control required, to create truly robust
components (arguably the essence of OO) is unreasonably difficult to instill</p>
</aside>

<aside id="patterns">
<h2>Design patterns</h2>
<p>Design patterns are usually described as solutions to common OO problems</p>
<p>But another point of view is that they represent weaknesses in current OO
languages which require trickery to circumvent</p>
<p>The idioms they present should instead be natural</p>
</aside>

<aside id="patterns">
<h2>... considered harmful</h2>
<p>Try looking up:</p>
<ul>
    <li>pointers considered harmful</li>
    <li>static considered harmful</li>
    <li>constructors considered harmful</li>
    <li>new considered harmful</li>
    <li>inheritance considered harmful</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of useful ideas emerge</p>
</aside>

<section style="position:relative;" data-animate="reveal">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here's a Java class that a student might write:</p>
<pre>class Grid {

        char[][] cells;

        Grid(char[][] c) { cells = c; }

        char[][] getCells() { return cells; }

}
</pre>
<p style="position:absolute;top:220px"><img src="arrow.png"/></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:290px"><img src="arrow.png"/></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:360px"><img src="arrow.png"/></p>
</section>

<section style="position:relative;">
<h2>Fixing the Example</h2>
<p>A Java class can be <em>made</em> robust:</p>
<pre>class Grid {

        <u>private</u> char[][] cells;

        Grid(char[][] c) { cells = <u>copy</u>(c); }

        char[][] getCells() { return <u>copy</u>(cells); }

}
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2>A big shock</h2>
<p>A little while after learning Java, I got a big shock</p>
<p>It isn't just student classes that are fragile:</p>
<p><strong>You can break Java library classes</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Breaking a hash table</h2>
<pre class="java">Set&lt;Item> set = new HashSet&lt;>();
set.add(item);
item.update();
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The hash code changed, the item is in the wrong slot</p>
<p>It is now a <em>quantum</em> hash table - the item is both in and not in the
set - i.e. it is <em>broken</em></p>
<p>This is very unlikely to happen, if it does, it is not just a bug, it is a
cockroach</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Psychology</h2>
<p>All languages are "the same", because they are all Turing Complete</p>
<p>But they differ in their psychological effect on program design and
development</p>
<p>Arguably, Java has a <b>bad</b> psychological effect</p>
<p>It encourages a lack of robustness</p>
<p>The same (probably) applies to every other popular or potentially popular
OO language</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The problem: aliasing</h2>
<p>An update via one pointer is visible via the other</p>
<img class="middle" src="alias.png" />
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> anti-aliasing</h2>
<p>In Runway, an assignment makes a copy</p>
<pre>1  point p.set(1,2);
2  point q = p;
3  q.set(3,4);
4  assert(p.x == 1 &amp;&amp; p.y == 2);
</pre>
<p>The copying is lazy</p>
<p>On line 2, <code>q</code> points to the same object as
<code>p</code></p>
<p>Copying happens on line 3 because <code>p</code> is "shared"</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<p>Lots of languages and libraries use related techniques - it is a ripe idea
(C, C++, Rust, Swift, Immutable.js, ...) :</p>
<ul>
<li>immutability</li>
<li>ownership</li>
<li>copy semantics</li>
<li>lazy copying</li>
<li>copy on write</li>
<li>persistent data structures</li>
</ul>
<p>Runway just takes the idea to its logical conclusion</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no pointers</h2>
<p>Java has no pointer <strong>notation</strong>, but you have to understand
pointers properly to use Java well</p>
<p>Runway has no pointers in its <strong>mental model</strong> =
<strong>semantics</strong></p>
<p>Pointers are just an implementation technique, used to cope with
<em>variable sizes</em> or to <em>save memory</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no null</h2>
<p>Languages have <code>null</code> as an <em>accident</em> of the pointer
notation</p>
<p>The most common uses are as empty structures or cheap exceptions</p>
<p>A null structure is justified in procedural languages, but not in OO
languages</p>
<p>So Runway has tagged unions and cheap exceptions</p>
<p>Notes:
<a class="jump" href="#unions">unions</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#exceptions">exceptions</a>
</p>
</section>

<aside id="unions">
<h2>Unions</h2>
<p>How should an empty list or tree be represented?</p>
<p>Null isn't available, and an exceptional value isn't OO, because you can't
ask questions such as "are you empty?"</p>
<p>Inheritance with an empty structure as a separate type works but seems too
heavy</p>
<p>The best bet seems to be a 'tagged union' - a notation which makes it nearly
as convenient as an algebraic type in Haskell would be good</p>
</aside>

<aside id="exceptions">
<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>The plan is: a method can return an exception value</p>
<p>Exceptions mix with any other type</p>
<p>That makes exception behaviour easily testable</p>
<p>An exception return value not explicitly handled by the end of its block
becomes an error and is thrown</p>
<p>The compiler tells you if any errors are uncaught</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no identity</h2>
<p>Some say that 'object identity' is an essential aspect of
OO, but it is just an accident of pointers</p>
<p>Runway doesn't have it: identity comes from a contained id or by associating
it with a key in a lookup structure</p>
<p>So Runway has <em>value</em> equality (hooray!)<br/>
(and perhaps <a class="jump" href="#keys">key equality</a>)</p>
</section>

<aside id="keys">
<h2>Key equality</h2>
<p>Key equality works by declaring that certain fields in an object form a
key</p>
<p>This has the advantages that equality and comparison and hashcodes
are automatic, have the right properties, are consistent with each other, and
cover most cases of equality that programmers want</p>
<p>This needs to be in addition to value equality (and possibly
allowing for alternative keys)</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> primitives</h2>
<p>In Java, objects and primitives are <strong>different</strong></p>
<p>In many languages, they are made the same by making primitives act like
objects ("boxing")</p>
<p>In Runway, they are made the same by making objects act like primitives</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no cycles</h2>
<p>Pointing to <code>o</code> is the same as containing <code>o</code></p>
<p>An object pointing to itself means containing itself</p>
<p>So it would be infinite</p>
<p>The lack of cycles has drastic consequences for program design and data
structures, but they are well understood</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no statics</h2>
<p>A consequence of anti-aliasing is that static variables are out,
because they have uncontrolled pointer aliasing:</p>
<img class="middle" src="static.png"/>
<p>Runway needs a different approach to global variables</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> anti-static</h2>
<p><em>Question:</em> What would you do without globals?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> you would pass objects down in calls</p>
<img class="middle" src="global.png"/>
<p><em>Definition:</em> making an object global is an abbreviation for passing
it to all the descendants of its owner</p>
<p>Notes:
<a class="jump" href="#scope">scope</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#singletons">singletons</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#escape">escape</a>
</p>
</section>

<aside id="scope">
<h2>Scope of globals</h2>
<p>The scope of a Runway global is all the descendants of its owner</p>
<p>That's a dynamic and relative scope</p>
<p>For static checking, perhaps an owner has a declaration "provide
<code>g</code> to
all descendants" and anything that uses <code>g</code> has a declaration
"require <code>g</code> from an ancestor"</p>
</aside>

<aside id="singletons">
<h2>Singletons</h2>
<p>A global can <strong>always</strong> be overridden with something else, so
there is no such thing as a program-wide singleton</p>
<p>From the Runway point of view, the singleton design pattern is misguided</p>
<p>Singletons are known to be bad for testing and flexibility anyway</p>
</aside>

<aside id="escape">
<h2>Escape</h2>
<p>It would seem sensible to allow a grandparent which provides a global, a
parent which is an ordinary list object, say, which knows nothing about the
global, and an item inside the list which accesses the global</p>
<p>But then it would also seem sensible to have a compile-time restriction
(based on escape analysis?) which prevents an item which uses a global from
being implicitly passed out of the scope of the global</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2><em>So:</em> no constructors</h2>
<p>A constructor is static (because there isn't yet an object to call a method
on)</p>
<p>So Runway doesn't have conventional constructors</p>
<p>But that's OK because conventional constructors and the <code>new</code>
keyword are 'considered harmful'</p>
<p>Constructors can't be inherited, and the phrase <code>new Thing()</code>
exposes some implementation details, preventing you from giving a recycled or
shared object, or a subclassed object (hence factory patterns)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> anti-new</h2>
<pre>point p;       // create p as a copy of a default
p.set(1,2);    // initialize its fields
</pre>
<p>When you declare a variable, it is initialized to a (lazy copy of a) default
object</p>
<p>That object has uninitialized fields, so it can't be used until they are
initialized</p>
<p><code>set</code> is an ordinary method, but with the <dfn>property</dfn> of
being a constructor</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>Here are some ways of creating a point:</p>
<pre>point p = new point(3, 4);      // Java
var p = new point(3, 4);        // JavaScript
var p = point(3, 4);            // Swift
point p.set(3, 4);              // Runway
</pre>
<p>Runway's version is syntactically shortest</p>
<p>More importantly, it is semantically simplest</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Class = type = object</h2>
<pre data-name="point.rw">
int x, y;

set(x0, y0) { x = x0; y = y0; }

x() { return x; }
y() { return y; }
</pre>
<p>Is it a class? Is it a prototype? It's an object</p>
<p>Notes:
<a class="jump" href="#name">names</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#private">private</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#singleton">singletons</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#infer">inference</a></p>
</section>

<aside id="name">
<h2>No class name</h2>
<p>Java starts with <code>class X</code>, but that must match the filename
<code>X.java</code> so it is redundant</p>
<p>So in Runway, file <code>point.rw</code> defines an object called
<code>point</code></p>
<p>Techinically, <code>point</code> is a variable which is global to the
directory it is in, so available to all files in the directory</p>
</aside>

<aside id="private">
<h2>Private fields</h2>
<p>For robustness, fields in Runway objects are always private</p>
<p><em>But</em> when testing rather than running a program, it is helpful to be
able to inspect field values</p>
<p><em>And</em> the notation <code>o.x</code> is redundant and free to be
reused to mean <code>o.x()</code> for getter <code>x()</code>, and
<code>o.x = y</code> could mean <code>o.x(y)</code> for setter
<code>x(_)</code></p>
</aside>

<aside id="singleton">
<h2>Singletons</h2>
<p>An object like <code>point</code> can directly be used as a singleton
instead of as a type</p>
<p>But the design-pattern version of singletons, where a global variable is
rigidly irreplaceable across a whole program is (it is easy to argue) just
wrong</p>
<p>A singleton is a potentially replaceable or duplicatable global variable</p>
</aside>

<aside id="infer">
<h2>Type inference</h2>
<p>It seems reasonable to have type inference, where it is easy</p>
<p>Exactly how far to take this in the language is unclear at present</p>
<p>Perhaps as far as Swift's type inference</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> call by copy</h2>
<pre data-name="grid.rw">...
window.display(cells);
...
</pre>
<p>The 'default' calling mechanism is <dfn>call-by-copy</dfn>
(i.e. call-by-value in the deep functional-programming/formal-semantics sense,
not the usual shallow OO sense)</p>
<p>So even if the <code>window</code> object is untrusted and updates the
argument, the <code>grid</code> object remains robust</p>
<p>However <em>delegation</em>, where you trust the software you build on, is
an important OO principle (for DRYness)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> call by lend</h2>
<pre data-name="program.rw">...
sorter.sort(&amp;xs);
...
</pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> means the method can update or
replace <code>xs</code></p>
<p>This is call-by-reference with a twist: the choice is made in the
call, not in the method signature, e.g. if all calls are implemented by
reference:</p>
<pre>o.f(x)      -->     temp = x; o.f(&amp;temp);
</pre>
<p>
<a class="jump" href="#swap">swap</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#sort">sort</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#call">calls</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#dot">dots</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#this">this</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#self">self</a>
</p>
</section>

<aside id="swap">
<h2>Swapping</h2>
<p>This works</p>
<pre>swap(a,b) {
    t = a;
    a = b;
    b = t;
}
...
swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
</pre>
</aside>

<aside id="sort">
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<p>This doesn't work</p>
<pre>...
swap(&amp;a[i], &amp;a[j]);
</pre>
<p>If allowed, it would swap two temporary variables, not the array contents, but
instead the compiler complains that you can't pass a non-variable expression by
reference, so <code>swap(a, i, j)</code> is needed</p>
</aside>

<aside id="call">
<h2>Implementation of calls</h2>
<p>All arguments that may involve updating are passed by reference</p>
<p>A call <code>f(x)</code> is translated if necessary to
<code>t = x; f(t)</code> which creates an extra reference so that a copy is made,
then any update or replacement or copy is done to <code>t</code> which is
then discarded</p>
</aside>

<aside id="dot">
<h2>The dot notation</h2>
<p>In OO, it is normal to write <code>x.f(y)</code>, thinking of method
<code>f</code> as attached to <code>x</code></p>
<p>In C notation, it is really <code>f(x,y)</code>, but with <code>f</code>
overloaded</p>
<p>In Runway, <code>x.f(y)</code> is equivalent to <code>f(&amp;x,y)</code>, so
<code>x</code> is expected to update itself as it wishes</p>
</aside>

<aside id="this">
<h2>Updating <code>this</code></h2>
<p>A method call <code>obj.f(x)</code> is equivalent to a function call
(in C, say) <code>f(obj, x)</code></p>
<p>It is reasonable to assume that the 'special' first argument is always an
update argument, because if you don't trust the object, you are going to tell
it things, but not ask it things, so it is OK for it to update itself</p>
</aside>

<aside id="self">
<h2><em>Feature:</em> self replacement</h2>
<p>Suppose you update a Runway object</p>
<pre>p.set(3,4);
</pre>
<p>If <code>p</code> is shared, it must be replaced by a copy</p>
<p>That gives you a language feature for free: the ability of an object
to replace itself</p>
<p>Delegation is an important OO principle, and now an object which you delegate
to can do anything you can</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> higher order calls</h2>
<p>Runway will allow functions to be passed, <em>but</em> a function is always
attached to an object as a method</p>
<p>The object is its closure (closures should <em>not</em> be a separate
concept, as in JavaScript)</p>
<p>A function is passed as an object with a marked method (maybe explicitly like
Java's <code>...(x::f)</code>)</p>
<p>There is syntactic, semantic and implementation work to do here
(<a class="jump" href="#aliases">aliases</a>,
<a class="jump" href="#dispatch">dispatch</a>)</p>
</section>

<aside id="aliases">
<h2>No aliasing</h2>
<pre class="java">update(x, y) {
    x = x + 1;
    y = y * 2;
}
...
update(&amp;z, &amp;z);
</pre>
<p>This can't be allowed, because there is no sensible possible final value for
<code>z</code> (if <code>z</code> is <code>2</code>, <code>x=3</code> and
<code>y=4</code>)</p>
<p>Fortunately, this only arises if the same explicit variable name is
used, so it shouldn't be an obscure issue</p>
<p>A call <code>x.f(this)</code> is also very dubious</p>
</aside>

<aside id="dispatch">
<h2><em>Feature:</em> multiple dispatch</h2>
<p>Runway gets rid of the nonsense of the visitor design pattern by providing
double, triple, ... dispatch</p>
<p>The visitor pattern looks good, then turns out to be very obscure, and anyway
<em>it doesn't fully solve the problem you are trying to solve</em> (i.e. easy
addition of one class in either of two families)</p>
<p>Multiple dispatch is easy to implement, and as efficient as any of the
alternatives</p>
</aside>

<section>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Arguably, there are two kinds of inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <dfn>subtype</dfn> makes the same semantic promise</li>
<li>an <dfn>interface</dfn> requires only the same API</li>
</ul>
<p>Java's <code>extends</code> inheritance is interface inheritance plus
code/field reuse, and is considered harmful</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> subtypes</h2>
<pre class="java">vehicle car;
car.set(...);
car c;
</pre>
<p>Runway gives an absolute promise: <strong>c is a vehicle</strong></p>
<pre class="java">statement theorem;
theorem.restrict();
theorem t.set(s, p);
</pre>
<p>Maybe you could add methods, but not override them, or gain access to the
private fields</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> properties</h2>
<p>Runway has a notation for declaring <em>properties</em>, e.g.</p>
<pre data-name="point.rw">
constructor: set
getter: x, y

int x, y

set(x0, y0) { x = x0; y = y0; }
</pre>
<p>For <code>constructor</code>, the compiler can check</p>
<p>For <code>getter</code>, it can also generate boiler-plate code</p>
<p>Properties are <strong>necessary</strong> for robustness</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> delegation</h2>
<pre class="java" data-name="window.rw">delegate to r: width, height, area
...
rectangle r;
</pre>
<p>This is composition ('has-a') inheritance, close to subtype inheritance</p>
<p>(Possible optimisation in the implementation: extends)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> interfaces</h2>
<pre class="java" data-name="car.rw">like vehicle: car
...
wheels() { return 4; }
</pre>
<p>Java problem: can't retro-fit interfaces in libraries</p>
<p>In Runway, any type can be used as an interface</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> reusability</h2>
<pre class="java" data-name="rect.rw">area() { return width() * height(); }
</pre>
<p>The <em>area</em> method is reusable in any type that has
<code>width()</code> and <code>height()</code></p>
<pre class="java" data-name="window.rw">like rectangle: window
reuse: area
...
</pre>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Safe hash tables</h2>
<pre class="java" data-name="record.rw">getter: key;
...
</pre>
<pre class="java" data-name="table.rw">type parameter: R
like record: R
new(R) { ... }
...
</pre>
<p>For a safe hash table, as well as anti-aliasing, the <code>key</code>
method in the <code>R</code> type must be a getter, i.e.
not cause an update to the record or read from a global variable</p>
<p>In Runway, properties are inherited as well as APIs</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Memory shared threads</h2>
<p>Memory sharing concurrency is diabolical:</p>
<p>The standards for C and Java define a 'lowest common denominator' of hardware
support and are incredibly complex and obscure</p>
<p>The Java library sources have thread issues in nearly every class; that's
<em>not</em> orthogonal or encapsulated</p>
<p><em>non-determinism, deadlock, livelock, starvation, ...</em></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Message passing threads</h2>
<p>Message passing provides a language in which to be explicit about and reason
about concurrency problems</p>
<p>But <em>it doesn't solve any of them</em></p>
<p>Arguably, a classic case of building a substantial theory around a broken
idea</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> threads</h2>
<p>An object can introduce a new thread</p>
<p>The thread 'owns' the object and all the data below it</p>
<p>Method calls on the object look normal, so the new thread is
an annotation</p>
<p>Access to the result or an updated argument by the parent thread causes
a synchronizing pause</p>
<p>This is message-passing concurrency</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Determinism</h2>
<p>The intention is that the program <em>with</em> the thread annotation
has identical functionality to the program <em>without</em> it</p>
<p>So, the concurrency can <em>only</em> be used for latency hiding</p>
<p>But that's enough for many purposes, including servers and graphics (graphics
libraries always used to be threaded, but they have typically moved to the
callback style, which is fairly diabolical)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><em>Feature:</em> events</h2>
<p>Communications are handled via a very old concept: the single
input stream of events</p>
<p><em>All</em> events are in the stream, and the ordering is critical - it
defines their relative timings</p>
<p>That means auto-dispatch to the right place is either banned or implemented
with extreme care</p>
<p>So: still deterministic</p>

<h2><em>Feature:</em> injection</h2>
<p>Non-determinism is handled by adding one feature:</p>
<p>The program can inject an event into the stream (at a time-dependent
position)</p>
<p>You can <dfn>replay</dfn> a program from a <dfn>recorded</dfn> event stream</p>
<p>Then you can debug and (regression) test programs!</p>
</section>

<h2>Thought experiments</h2>
<p>Understanding of the system at the moment is based around thought experiments
of possible programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>operating system</li>
<li>splat the rat</li>
<li>server</li>
<li>graphics library</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>Operating system</h2>
<p>A program <code>OS</code> runs two other programs <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code> as modules, not as separate processes</p>
<p>It needs <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to run in their own threads</p>
<p>It needs to set up a 'fake' system environment of global
variables and devices etc. separately for <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></p>
<p>And it needs to unzip the event stream into two event streams</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Splat the rat</h2>
<p>Think of an X-Window style system:</p>
<img class="middle" src="gui.png"/>
<p>The program sends a "hide rat" graphics request and asks for an
acknowledgement to be injected into the event stream</p>
<p>The player wins if the click event comes before the acknowledgement</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>An update request, in its own thread, updates a copy of the database,
and ends by injecting a 'new database version' event into the queue</p>
<p>Read requests after the injection see the new version</p>
<p>The update requests would have to be serialized</p>
<p>Or the database can be split into independent pieces to allow concurrent
updating (like locking)</p>
<p>Or the updates could be merged, with retries (like speculative
versioning)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Graphics library</h2>
<p>There is much work to be done here, but there is a prospect of a
<em>much</em> more sensible system than usual</p>
<p>Semantically sensible latency hiding may depend on splitting a window into
independent subwindows which can be drawn on concurrently without
interference</p>
